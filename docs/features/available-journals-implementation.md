## What Changed

### Replaced "Selected Journals" with "Available Journals"

**Before:**

- Section showed already-selected journals
- Users couldn't see journals to select
- No way to browse and select journals

**After:**

- Shows ALL available journals from selected fields
- Users can see and scroll through all journals
- Checkboxes allow users to select journals they want
- Displays count: "Available Journals (28)"
- Select All / Clear All buttons for bulk actions

---

## How It Works

### User Flow

1. **Select Field(s)** in "Field of Research" dropdown
   - Multi-select multiple fields
2. **See Available Journals** automatically populate

   - Only journals from selected fields shown
   - Shows title, ISSN, and rating badge
   - Empty message if no fields selected

3. **Select Journals** using checkboxes

   - Click checkbox to select journal
   - Multiple journals can be selected
   - Selection persists in state

4. **Manage Selection**
   - "Select All" → Check all visible journals
   - "Clear All" → Uncheck all journals
   - Buttons only appear when journals are available

## Component Changes

### SelectedJournalsSidebar.tsx - Completely Redesigned

**Old Behavior:**

```typescript
// Only showed already-selected journals
selectedJournals.length > 0 ? (
  // Display selected journals with remove buttons
) : (
  // Show empty message
)
```

**New Behavior:**

```typescript
// Shows ALL available journals with checkboxes
availableJournals.length > 0 ? (
  // Display all available journals as selectable checkboxes
) : (
  // Show helpful message (no fields selected or no journals available)
)
```
