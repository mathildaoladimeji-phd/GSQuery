## What Changed

### 1. ✅ Dropdown Auto-Collapse on Click Outside

**Before:**
- Opening the "Field of Research" dropdown would keep it open
- Required manually clicking the dropdown button to close it
- User experience was not intuitive

**After:**
- Dropdown automatically closes when clicking anywhere outside it
- Click-outside detector uses event listener
- Clean UX - dropdown closes as soon as selection is made or user clicks elsewhere

### 2. ✅ Increased Sidebar Width

**Before:**
- Sidebar width: `w-80` (320px)
- Main content offset: `ml-80` (320px)
- Felt cramped for displaying all information

**After:**
- Sidebar width: `w-96` (384px) - **+64px wider**
- Main content offset: `ml-96` (384px)
- More breathing room for filter sections and journal list
- Better visual balance

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Click-Outside Handler

**File:** `components/sidebar/sections/FieldOfResearchSidebar.tsx`

Added useRef and useEffect for click-outside detection:
- Tracks dropdown element with ref
- Listens for mousedown events
- Closes dropdown if click is outside
- Properly cleans up event listeners

### 2. Sidebar Width Increase

**File:** `components/layouts/MainLayout.tsx`

Changes from 320px to 384px:
- Changed `w-80` to `w-96`
- Changed `ml-80` to `ml-96`
- Updated main content offset accordingly
