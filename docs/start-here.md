## ‚ùì Common Questions

**Q: Can I search without journal filters?**  
A: Yes! Leave all fields blank or don't select filters. Default includes all ratings.

**Q: What does "Is Exact" do?**  
A: Finds the exact phrase. Without it, finds papers containing your words separately.

**Q: How many search blocks can I add?**  
A: As many as you want! Each narrows or broadens results based on the operator.

**Q: What if I get zero results?**  
A: Try removing "Is Exact", adding related terms with OR, or expanding journal ratings.

**Q: What if I get too many results?**  
A: Add more AND blocks to narrow, limit to A\* journals only, or use "Is Exact" for precision.
