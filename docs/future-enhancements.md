# Google Scholar Query Builder - Future Enhancements

This document outlines potential future enhancements for the Google Scholar Query Builder application based on the current implementation.

## 1. Query Templates

### Description

Implement a system for saving, loading, and sharing search query templates to streamline the search process for common research patterns.

### Implementation Plan

1. Create a template data structure with:

   - Template name and description
   - Pre-configured search blocks
   - Global filter settings
   - Optional metadata (category, tags, etc.)

2. Add template management UI:

   - Save current query as template
   - Browse and select from available templates
   - Import/export templates for sharing

3. Include pre-defined templates for common search patterns:
   - Systematic review search
   - Author impact analysis
   - Emerging research identification
   - Citation analysis

### Technical Considerations

- Store templates in localStorage or optionally in a cloud database
- Implement version control for templates to handle field structure changes
- Add template validation to ensure compatibility

## 2. Citation Count Filtering

### Description

Enhance the query builder with options to filter results by citation count ranges to help users find highly-cited or emerging research.

### Implementation Plan

1. Add citation count filter UI:

   - Minimum citation count slider/input
   - Maximum citation count slider/input
   - Special options for uncited papers or highly-cited papers

2. Implement the appropriate URL parameters:

   - Research the best approach for citation filtering in Google Scholar
   - Likely requires custom parameters or search syntax

3. Add visualization of citation thresholds:
   - Guidance on what constitutes high/medium/low citation counts
   - Field-specific citation benchmark information

### Technical Considerations

- Google Scholar doesn't have an official parameter for citation filtering
- May require approximation techniques or special syntax
- Consider implementing as a post-processing step on search results

## 3. Advanced Results Analysis

### Description

Add capabilities for analyzing and visualizing search results to help users identify patterns and trends.

### Implementation Plan

1. Implement results scraping and parsing:

   - Visualization of journal metrics
   - Journal recommendation based on topic

### Technical Considerations

- Need to regularly update journal metadata
- Consider licensing requirements for impact factor data
- Implement efficient filtering for large journal datasets

## 5. Natural Language Query Processing

### Description

Add support for natural language query input that gets translated into structured search blocks.

### Implementation Plan

1. Implement query parsing:

   - Parse natural language descriptions of research needs
   - Extract key concepts, authors, journals, date ranges, etc.
   - Map to appropriate search fields and operators

2. Create interactive refinement UI:

   - Show structured interpretation of natural language input
   - Allow users to adjust and refine the interpretation
   - Provide suggestions for query improvement

3. Add machine learning-based improvements:
   - Learn from user refinements to improve parsing
   - Suggest related terms based on research context
   - Identify potential missing concepts

### Technical Considerations

- Requires NLP capabilities or API integration
- Need to handle ambiguity in natural language
- Consider privacy implications of query processing

## 6. Author Profile Integration

### Description

Add support for author profile lookup and integration with ORCID and other researcher identifiers.

### Implementation Plan

1. Implement author lookup:

   - Search for authors by name
   - Retrieve ORCID and other identifiers
   - Display author publication history and metrics

2. Add author-specific search features:

   - Search by ORCID ID
   - Filter by author's institution or field
   - Find collaborators of specific authors

3. Create author network visualization:
   - Show collaboration networks
   - Display citation relationships
   - Identify key influencers in research fields

### Technical Considerations

- Need API integration with ORCID and other services
- Consider caching for performance
- Implement privacy controls for author information

## 7. Search History and Analytics

### Description

Add a comprehensive search history system with analytics to help users track and improve their research process.

### Implementation Plan

1. Implement search history tracking:

   - Save all executed searches with timestamp and results summary
   - Allow organization and tagging of searches
   - Implement search comparison features

2. Create research analytics:

   - Track evolution of search strategies
   - Identify most productive search patterns
   - Suggest improvements based on past searches

3. Add collaboration features:
   - Share search history with colleagues
   - Annotate searches with notes
   - Create collaborative research workspaces

### Technical Considerations

4. Search History and Analytics (Medium value, low complexity)
5. Integration with Reference Management (Medium value, moderate complexity)
6. Mobile Optimization (Medium value, moderate complexity)
7. Author Profile Integration (Medium value, high complexity)
8. Advanced Results Analysis (High value, high complexity)

## Conclusion

These potential enhancements would significantly expand the capabilities of the Google Scholar Query Builder, transforming it from a query construction tool into a comprehensive academic search platform. The modular architecture of the current implementation provides a solid foundation for adding these features incrementally based on user needs and available resources.
