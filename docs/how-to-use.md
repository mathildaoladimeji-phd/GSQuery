## Getting Started

The Query Builder helps you create sophisticated, precise searches for academic papers on Google Scholar. Instead of typing complex query syntax manually, you build your search visually using an intuitive interface.

### The Three-Step Process

1. **Add Search Terms** - Create search blocks with your keywords
2. **Configure Filters** - Apply journal ratings, fields of study, and year ranges
3. **Execute Search** - Click "Search on Google Scholar" to open results

The generated query appears in real-time as you make changes, so you can preview exactly what will be searched.

## Understanding Search Blocks

### What is a Search Block?

A search block is a single search criterion that specifies:

- **Where to search** (Search In: Article Title, Author, Source, Abstract, etc.)
- **What to search for** (Your keywords)
- **How precise** (Regular search or exact phrase match)

### Default Search Block

When you open the Query Builder, you start with one search block set to "All Fields" - the most general search option.

### Adding More Search Blocks

Click the **"Add Another Search"** button to add additional search blocks. Each new block:

- Starts as "All Fields" by default
- Can be independently configured
- Connects to the previous block with a boolean operator (AND/OR)

### Removing Search Blocks

To remove a search block, click the **"✕" button** on the right side of that block. You must have at least one block, so the button is disabled when only one block remains.

### Search Block Layout

Each search block contains:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [Search In ▼] [Search Term Input]     [✕]   │
│ [Is Exact □]  [Operator: AND ▼]            │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Search In Dropdown** - Select where to search
- **Search Term Input** - Type your keywords
- **Is Exact Checkbox** - Toggle exact phrase matching
- **Operator Dropdown** - Configure relationship to other blocks
- **Delete Button** - Remove this block

### Best Practices

✅ **DO:**

- Use specific field selections for precision (e.g., search for author name in "Author" field rather than "All Fields")
- Start broad, then add constraints to narrow results
- Use one concept per block (search for specific authors in one block, topics in another)
- Group related terms in the same block

❌ **DON'T:**

- Put multiple unrelated topics in a single block
- Use complex boolean syntax in the search term (the operators handle this)
- Leave search terms empty - blocks with no text are ignored

---

## Working with Operators

Operators control how multiple search blocks relate to each other. They determine whether papers must satisfy all criteria, any criteria, or should exclude certain criteria.

### Operator Types

#### AND Operator

**Meaning:** Papers must contain BOTH search terms

**Usage:** When you want to narrow results by adding more requirements

**Example:**

```
Block 1: [Author] "John Smith"
AND
Block 2: [Article Title] "machine learning"
```

Returns papers where John Smith is an author AND the title contains "machine learning"

**When to use:**

- Adding restrictions to results
- Requiring multiple concepts to be present
- Increasing precision

#### OR Operator

**Meaning:** Papers can contain EITHER search term (or both)

**Usage:** When you want to broaden results or search for synonyms

**Example:**

```
Block 1: [Article Title] "artificial intelligence"
OR
Block 2: [Article Title] "machine learning"
```

Returns papers where the title contains "artificial intelligence" OR "machine learning" OR both

**When to use:**

- Searching for multiple related terms
- Finding papers about similar concepts
- Increasing recall (finding more papers)

#### EXCLUDE Operator (NOT)

**Meaning:** Papers must NOT contain this search term

**Usage:** When you want to eliminate unwanted results

**Example:**

```
Block 1: [Article Title] "machine learning"
EXCLUDE
Block 2: [Article Title] "supervised learning"
```

Returns papers with "machine learning" in the title that do NOT contain "supervised learning"

**When to use:**

- Excluding specific subtopics
- Removing known papers
- Filtering out irrelevant domains

### Operator Rules and Constraints

The system prevents invalid operator combinations:

❌ **Cannot do:**

- Use AND/OR after an EXCLUDE block
  - ✓ Fix: Rearrange blocks so EXCLUDE is last
- Use EXCLUDE on the first block (it needs something to exclude from)
  - ✓ Fix: Add a regular search block first
- Use "with next block" operator on the last block (no next block exists)
  - ✓ Fix: Reorder blocks or remove the empty next block

**Error Messages:**

If you see a red error indicator on a block, the system will show you:

- What the problem is
- How to fix it
- Valid operator options for your current situation

### Operator Positioning

**First Block:** Can only use AND/OR with the next block, or be used with EXCLUDE in the next block

**Middle Blocks:** Can use AND/OR with the previous block, or EXCLUDE from the next block

**Last Block:** Can only use AND/OR with the previous block

### Complex Queries

Combine multiple blocks and operators for sophisticated searches:

```
Block 1: [Article Title] "deep learning"
AND
Block 2: [Author] "Yann LeCun"
AND
Block 3: [Source] "Nature"
EXCLUDE
Block 4: [Keywords] "computer vision"
```

This finds papers with "deep learning" in the title, written by Yann LeCun, published in Nature, but NOT about computer vision.

## Using the "Is Exact" Feature

The "Is Exact" checkbox controls whether your search term must match exactly or can match partial text.

### Regular Search (Is Exact = OFF)

**Behavior:** Finds papers where the text CONTAINS your search term

**Example:** Searching "machine" finds papers with "machine learning", "state machine", "learning machines", etc.

**When to use:**

- Searching for general concepts
- When you want to find variations of a word
- Broad searches to maximize results

### Exact Match Search (Is Exact = ON)

**Behavior:** Finds papers where the text matches your search term as a phrase

**Example:** Searching "machine learning" (with Exact ON) finds papers where those exact words appear together in that order

**When to use:**

- Searching for specific phrases
- Paper or author names
- Technical terms that need precision
- Journal titles
- ISSN numbers

### Real-World Differences

**Query:** "neural network"

| Is Exact OFF                                                                 | Is Exact ON                                               |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Finds: "neural networks", "convolutional neural network", "recurrent neural" | Finds: "neural network", "neural networks" (exact phrase) |
| ~2.5M results                                                                | ~150K results                                             |
| Broader, more results                                                        | Narrower, more precise                                    |

### When to Use Each

**Use Regular (OFF):**

- General topic searches
- Exploring a field
- When you want comprehensive results
- Initial research phases

**Use Exact (ON):**

- Looking for specific phrases
- Searching author names (e.g., "John Smith")
- Journal titles
- Technical terms with specific meaning
- Known paper titles
- ISSN/ISBN numbers

### Combining With Field Selection

**Most Effective:**

- Exact match + Specific field = High precision
- Example: [Author] "Mary Anne Thalmann" (Is Exact ON)

**Least Effective:**

- Exact match + All Fields = May return too few results
- Regular search + All Fields = May return too many results

## Journal Filtering

The Query Builder includes access to 2,510 academic journals classified by research field and quality rating.

### Journal Rating System

Journals are rated on a four-tier system:

#### A\* (Tier 1 - Highest Quality)

- **Count:** 193 journals
- **Characteristics:** Top-tier, highly selective, maximum prestige
- **Examples:** Nature, Science, PNAS
- **When to filter:** When you need only the very best sources

#### A (Tier 2)

- **Count:** 623 journals
- **Characteristics:** High quality, rigorous peer review
- **Examples:** IEEE Transactions, Journal of Machine Learning Research
- **When to filter:** For high-quality research

#### B (Tier 3)

- **Count:** 800 journals
- **Characteristics:** Good quality, solid peer review
- **Examples:** Many domain-specific journals, good conferences
- **When to filter:** For credible research across disciplines

#### C (Tier 4)

- **Count:** 894 journals
- **Characteristics:** Established journals, peer reviewed
- **Examples:** Specialized research journals, emerging fields
- **When to filter:** For comprehensive coverage

### Fields of Research

Journals are organized into fields:

**Commerce, Management, Tourism & Services:**

- Accounting, auditing and accountability
- Banking, finance and investment
- Business systems in context
- Commercial services
- Human resources and industrial relations
- Marketing
- Strategy, management and organisational behaviour
- Tourism
- Transportation, logistics and supply chains

**Economics:**

- Applied economics
- Econometrics
- Economic theory

**Technology & Information:**

- Information systems
- Statistics

**Law:**

- Commercial law

### Filtering by Field and Rating

1. **Select Field(s)** - Check one or more research fields in the left sidebar
2. **Available Journals Update** - The journal list updates to show only journals in selected fields
3. **Select Rating(s)** - Check which journal ratings you want to include
4. **Quick Actions:**
   - **"Show All"** - Include all four rating tiers
   - **"Show None"** - Clear all selections (must re-select)
5. **Select Journals** - Check specific journals or use "Select All"

### Journal Selection Tips

✅ **Start with ratings:**

- Default is A\* only (most prestigious)
- Click "Show All" to include all ratings
- Custom combinations work too (e.g., A\* + A for high-quality only)

✅ **Combine with field:**

- Filter by relevant research field first
- Then adjust ratings for precision
- Prevents irrelevant journals from appearing

✅ **Use Select All wisely:**

- "Select All" selects all journals currently visible (based on field + rating filters)
- Not all 2,510 journals at once
- Precision increases with constraints

❌ **Avoid:**

- Selecting too many journals (makes query very long)
- Mixing unrelated fields
- Using C-rated journals without good reason

### Journal Filtering Example

**Scenario:** Finding papers on machine learning in top-tier AI journals

1. Field: Select "Information systems"
2. Rating: Click "Show All" (or just use A\*)
3. Journals: Find and select:
   - IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence
   - Journal of Machine Learning Research
   - ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology

**Result:** Query searches only in these high-quality journals for machine learning papers

## Tips and Tricks

### Speed Up Your Search

1. **Set Journal Filters First** - Narrows down results before you search
2. **Use Specific Fields** - "Author" field is faster than "All Fields"
3. **Apply Year Constraints** - Older papers are less relevant for fast-moving fields
4. **Copy Successful Queries** - The generated query is copyable for future use

### Refine Results Iteratively

1. Run a broad search (many blocks, OR operators)
2. Review results in Google Scholar
3. Return to Query Builder
4. Add AND blocks to narrow results
5. Repeat until you find what you need

### Debug Failing Searches

**If you get few/no results:**

1. Remove the "Is Exact" toggle - try broader search

## Common Issues

### Issue: "Red error on operator"

**Cause:** Invalid operator combination (e.g., AND after EXCLUDE)

**Solution:**

- Read the error message
- Follow the suggested fix
- System only allows valid combinations

**Prevention:**

- Keep EXCLUDE blocks at the end
- Use EXCLUDE after regular search blocks
- Position AND/OR blocks logically

### Issue: "No results found"

**Causes and Fixes:**

| Issue                              | Fix                                  |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Search too specific                | Remove "Is Exact", use broader terms |
| Journal filters too restrictive    | Include B and C ratings, "Show All"  |
| Year range too narrow              | Expand the date range                |
| Author/source misspelled           | Double-check capitalization          |
| All AND operators, no alternatives | Add OR blocks with synonyms          |

### Issue: "Too many results"

**Causes and Fixes:**

| Issue                    | Fix                             |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Too broad search         | Add AND blocks to narrow        |
| Journal filters too open | Limit to A\* only               |
| Year range too wide      | Constrain to recent years       |
| All OR operators         | Add AND blocks for requirements |

### Issue: "Special characters in search term"

**Solution:**

- Avoid special characters like @, #, $, %, &
- Use hyphens carefully (may be interpreted as exclusion)
- Quote marks are handled automatically by "Is Exact"
- If uncertain, run search without special characters first

### Issue: "Query too long"

**Cause:** Too many journals selected or very long search terms

**Solution:**

- Reduce number of journals (select most relevant only)
- Simplify search terms
- Remove unnecessary blocks
- Use fewer OR blocks
