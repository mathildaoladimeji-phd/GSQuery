  - Comprehensive documentation and inline code comments
  - Follow-up validation and correction documentation (`docs/corrections-applied.md`)

### Notes

- Journal filtering provides significantly higher precision than Google Scholar's basic interface
- Boolean operator logic now properly handles complex query relationships
- All major UI/UX issues from user feedback have been resolved
- System successfully compiles and builds without errors using bun
