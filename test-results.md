## URL Encoding Test

All queries were properly URL-encoded in the final URLs, with spaces converted to `%20` and special characters handled correctly.

## Conclusion

The Google Scholar Query Builder successfully handles all the test cases, including the four specific examples requested and a variety of edge cases. The implementation correctly:

1. Applies field-specific operators (intitle:, author:, etc.)
2. Handles boolean relationships between search blocks (AND, OR, NOT)
3. Applies proper parenthetical grouping for complex expressions
4. Handles journal filtering with ISSN-based search
5. Properly URL-encodes the final query

The implementation is robust against various edge cases including empty inputs, invalid operators, and malformed data.

## Recent Bug Fixes and Enhancements

### Journal Selection Integration Bug (Fixed)

A bug was discovered where selected journals were not being included in the main query when using the "Search Google Scholar" button:

- **Issue**: Journal selections made via the SimplifiedJournalSelector were correctly displayed in the QueryPreview component but were not being passed to the buildScholarUrl function in the main search handler.

- **Solution**: Modified the handleSearch function in QueryBuilder.tsx to properly include selectedJournalISSNs in the globalFilters object.

- **Additional Fix**: Changed code blocks to pre elements in the result display to ensure proper formatting of complex queries with HTML special characters.

### Term Quoting Behavior Enhancement

Modified the quoting behavior for search terms and journals:

- **Added "Is Exact" Checkbox**: Added a new checkbox next to each search term that determines whether the term should be wrapped in quotation marks.
- **Updated Quoting Logic**: Terms are now only quoted when the "Is Exact" checkbox is checked, giving users control over exact phrase matching.
- **Removed Journal Quoting**: Removed quotation marks from journal ISSNs in the query construction, as requested.

The project is now ready for deployment with all known bugs fixed and requested enhancements implemented.
